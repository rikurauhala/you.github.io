# User manual

## About

This project is a **professional portfolio website** for developers who host their source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This application offers an alternative to the tedious task of creating your own portfolio website.

The application code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). However, no knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript is required to set up the project for your own needs. Just some light configuration is needed to get started. Anyone is free to fork or clone this project and create their own version. This manual contains instructions for doing so.

## Getting started

### How to install

Start by getting the source code. Use one of the following ways to clone the repository from the command line. Alternatively, you may download the source code as a [zip package](https://github.com/rikurauhala/you.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```bash
# Get the source code via the command line
# Choose the way you are most familiar with
 
# Clone with SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:rikurauhala/you.github.io.git

# Clone with HTTPS
$ git clone https://github.com/rikurauhala/you.github.io.git

# Clone with GitHub CLI
$Â gh repo clone rikurauhala/you.github.io
```

Next, make sure you are in the correct folder and install dependencies. The application will not work without installing dependencies first!

```bash
# Change directory
$ cd you.github.io

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

### How to configure

#### Configuration file

The application requires some configuration. Start by renaming or copying the file `.env.default` into a new file called `.env`. Open the file in your favourite editor and replace the values with your own. It's okay to commit the .env file if you want, as it contains no secrets.

The contents of the .env configuration file are the following.

```bash
#
# Use this file to control the behaviour of the application
# Remember to replace with your own values and rename to '.env'
#

# USERNAME - mandatory
# Your GitHub username
REACT_APP_USERNAME='username'

# NAME - optional
# Your real name
REACT_APP_NAME='Firstname Lastname'

# KEYWORD - optional
# Use this keyword to control which repositories will show up in the application
# Add the keyword to all repositories on GitHub to mark them as part of your portfolio
REACT_APP_KEYWORD='portfolio'

# URL - optional
# Custom url, if your application has one
# Otherwise the url is assumed to be username.github.io
REACT_APP_URL='www.example.com'
```

#### Projects

The benefit of using this application as your portfolio (instead of just using your GitHub profile) is the ability to choose which projects you want to display. To choose the projects to be displayed, start by specifying a *keyword* in the configuration file. By default, the keyword is "portfolio". You can change the keyword if you wish.

Next, take a look at your public repositories on your GitHub profile. Mark the relevant projects by adding the chosen keyword in the [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) section of each project repository. I would also recommend adding other relevant topics as they will get displayed in the projects section.

In the projects section the projects are listed by update date, latest first. This way your latest and most active projects will always be at the top of the list.

#### Content

The application has two diffent configurable sections for user content. Content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

##### About

The first one is the *About* section. This is where you can write anything about yourself you wish to tell the people visiting your portfolio. Remember that this is intended to be your professional site so you may want to write about your education, career or professional interests. You may also provide instructions on how to contact you, for example via email or on LinkedIn.

As the content is written in Markdown, it is possible to divide it into smaller sections and use different levels of [headings](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings).

Contents of the *About* section can be written by editing the file **src/content/about.md**.

##### Projects

The second configurable section is the *Projects* section. Your project details are automatically fetched from GitHub, but you may want to provide some additional details here.

Contents of the *Projects* section can be written by editing the file **src/content/projects.md**.

##### Custom

Adding custom sections should be straightforward. Create a new component in the **src/components** directory and write the contents in a new markdown (.md) file in the **src/content** directory. For example, you may want to consider creating a custom section for your professional social media accounts.

#### Custom domain

If you deploy the application to GitHub Pages, it is possible to use a custom domain. In the **public** directory, create a file called `CNAME`. In the file, write your custom domain name such as www.example.com. Refer to the official GitHub Pages [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) for more detailed instructions.

### How to run

Start the application from the command line after installing the dependencies and configuring the application to use your username and other details. For production, I would recommend deploying the app to GitHub Pages. See instructions below.

```bash
# Run the application
$ npm start
```

### How to deploy

After making sure the application works as intended and it displays the data you want, you can deploy it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is recommended to host the source code in a repository named `username.github.io`. To use a custom domain, see instructions above.

```bash
# Deploy the application to GitHub pages
$ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy"
```
