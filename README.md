## About

This project offers a quick and easy way for developers to set up and deploy a portfolio website to showcase their work. It uses the GitHub API to automatically fetch up-to-date information from your profile! Simply plug in your GitHub username, write a short bio about yourself and describe your work briefly. Then you can focus on what is important: your work here on GitHub. Please refer to the documentation for more information.

## Demo

Here is what the application looks like with the profile of the [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat). See [rauhala.io](https://rauhala.io) for a real world example.
